# QnA

### Planning

> What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

- I could see the inital view, where the user is supposed to enter a repo name, could be at risk because it requires routing logic to do it nicely.

- Accessibility may not be 100%.

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?

- Add loading state designs.

- Add unhappy path designs.

- Pagination or infinite scroll.

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

- Autocomplete in the search box.

- Filtering by tags.

- Fuzzy search for issues.

- Sort issues by comment engagement and recently updated.
